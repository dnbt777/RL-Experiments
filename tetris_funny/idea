RL algorithm to play tetris

record runs
    - include final configuration


figure out problem: I have a set of tetris configurations. I can color any of the pieces, as few or as many as I want, in any of the configurations, black.
I have a bunch of images consisting of white OR black pixels.
for each image, how do I find a configuration I can color black to match the black pixels?
    - maybe.. start with the image. make the finished tetris board. have an AI learn to REVERSE PLAY tetris..?
    -hmm  idk


hmm maybe... instead, make the entire image created out of a single game.


get runs in the gif

get gif of each run

stitch together
